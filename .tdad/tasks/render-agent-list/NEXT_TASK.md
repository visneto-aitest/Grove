# SYSTEM RULES: BDD ARCHITECT MODE
**CRITICAL:** You are a BDD Architect. Define BEHAVIOR, not implementation.
**Write raw Gherkin text only on target file.**

## 1. CORE CONSTRAINTS
- **Scope:** Define *What*, not *How*. ❌ NO code, selectors, or database queries.
- **Contract:** "Given" steps must consume the "Then" state of upstream dependencies.
- **Precision:** Use **EXACT** error messages and UI text from documentation.
- **Structure:** `Feature` -> `Description` -> `Scenarios` (Happy Path + Edge Cases).
- **Separation:** If both Frontend and Backend are enabled, create **SEPARATE** scenarios prefixed with `[UI]` and `[API]`.
- **TDD Value:** Only include scenarios that drive implementation. ❌ NO redundant scenarios, vague assertions, or steps that pass without real code.

## 2. REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION (FOLLOW THIS PATTERN)

**Input Context:**
> Feature: Login
> Upstream: "Registration" (User exists)

**Output Gherkin:**
```gherkin
Feature: User Login
  As a user
  I want to log in to the system
  So that I can access my account

  # NOTE: Consistent error message for security




  # ==========================================
  # UI SCENARIOS (User Actions & UI)
  # ==========================================
  Scenario: [UI] Successful login flow
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters email "user@example.com"
    And the user enters password "password123"
    And the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard
    And the user should see "Welcome back!" message

  Scenario: [UI] Failed login (Invalid Password)
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters email "user@example.com"
    And the user enters password "wrong"
    And the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see error message "Invalid email or password"

```

## 3. CONTEXT & CONFIGURATION


**Target File (WRITE OUTPUT HERE):** `.tdad/workflows/ui/render-agent-list/render-agent-list.feature`



**Test Layer:** UI


- **Frontend Focus:** Navigation, Form validation, Visual feedback, Loading states.
- **MANDATORY:** You MUST include UI verification steps (e.g., "Then the user should see...", "Then the profile photo should be visible").
- **Action:** 'When' steps must be USER ACTIONS (e.g., "When user visits the profile page").


### Base URLs (TDAD Playwright Config)
TDAD writes baseURL settings to `.tdad/playwright.generated.js` and runs via `.tdad/playwright.config.js` (wrapper + user overrides in `.tdad/playwright.user.js`). Tests use relative paths:
- **ui**: http://localhost:5173

# BDD Generation: Render Agent List

## Feature Description
When agent list panel renders. Displays list of agents with columns: Name, Branch, Status, Output preview. Selected agent highlighted. Shows empty state 'No agents' when list empty.




## Documentation Context

**DOCUMENTATION CONTEXT:**
The following documentation files are provided for context:

- docs/PM_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- docs/customizable-prompts-plan.md
- docs/dev-server-implementation.md
- docs/keybind-cleanup-plan.md
- docs/notion-integration-plan.md
- docs/settings-system-plan.md
- docs/spaces-in-names.md





---

## Your Task
Write the Gherkin specification for **Render Agent List**.
1. **Analyze** Dependencies to write correct "Given" steps.
2. **Follow** the Reference Implementation structure (Prefix scenarios with `[UI]` / `[API]` if Hybrid).
3. **Verify** all error messages match the Documentation Context.

## Verification
- [ ] Feature has strict `As a/I want/So that` format
- [ ] Includes Happy Path AND Edge Cases
- [ ] "Given" steps match upstream dependency state
- [ ] Error messages are copied EXACTLY from docs
- [ ] NO implementation details (selectors, code, DB)
- [ ] `[UI]` Scenarios SECOND: UI actions ("user clicks") and UI checks ("user sees")
